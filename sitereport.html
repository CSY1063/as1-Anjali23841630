            <h2>My Portfolio Website Development Journey</h2>
            <p>Embarking on the path of web development and design was both exhilarating and daunting. I approached it with eagerness to learn but also a bit of nervousness. As I delved into the basics of coding, design principles, and the debugging process, I encountered a mix of challenges and victories.</p>
            <p>At the outset, understanding HTML and CSS felt like deciphering a new language. I stumbled through tags and selectors, struggling to make sense of it all. But with persistence and practice, I started to grasp the concepts and gained confidence in building structured web pages and styling them.</p>
            <p>Coding wasn't always smooth sailing. There were frustrating moments when my code didn't behave as expected, leading to hours of debugging and troubleshooting. However, each issue I resolved taught me valuable lessons and propelled me forward.</p>
            <p>Throughout the module, I engaged in reflective discussions about my learning journey. These sessions helped me understand my progress, identify areas for improvement, and make creative decisions about my website's development.</p>
            <p>As I worked on my personal portfolio website, I focused on refining its technical and design aspects. I carefully selected fonts and colors that reflected my style and professionalism. Drawing inspiration from minimalist websites, I aimed for clean layouts and user-friendly navigation.</p>

            <h2>Validation Reports</h2>
            <p>To ensure quality, I regularly validated my HTML and CSS code, fixing any errors to maintain standards compliance. Screenshots of validation reports serve as evidence of my commitment to producing clean and well-structured code.</p>
            <p>Here are the screenshots of the validation report of my HTML & CSS code: </p>
