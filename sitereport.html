            <h2>My Site Development Experience</h2>
            <p>Throughout the process of developing my portfolio website, I've encountered various challenges and triumphs. Learning the basics of web development, coding, design, and debugging has been an enlightening journey.</p>
            <p>One of the major ups I experienced was grasping the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, enabling me to build the structure and style of my website effectively. However, I also faced downs such as debugging errors in my code and struggling with responsive design.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on my module experience, I've gained valuable insights into the importance of user interface (UI) design. I focused on creating a clean and intuitive design for my site, with careful consideration of font choices, colors, and layout.</p>
            <p>I drew inspiration from various websites and design resources, such as Dribbble and Behance, to inform my design decisions. By studying successful websites, I gained insights into effective design principles and applied them to my own project.</p>
