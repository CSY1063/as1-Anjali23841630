                    <p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and have been working in the web development industry for over five years. My journey began with a curiosity for coding and a desire to create something meaningful.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, I've developed expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks. I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to deliver cutting-edge solutions to my clients.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting in the kitchen, or spending time with my family and friends.</p>
